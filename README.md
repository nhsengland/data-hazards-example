# Example of a project using data hazards

This repository is a mock-up of how a data science project at NHS England could communicate what might go wrong in data science projects, using the labels from the Data Hazards Project.

You can find out more about the Data Hazards Project on the [website][dh-site].

## Description

We are thinking about how we can use the Data Hazard labels to talk about ethical hazards in data science projects in the data science team at NHS ENgland. This README.md contains an example of how this might look.
