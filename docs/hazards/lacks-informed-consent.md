## Description

This hazard applies to datasets or algorithms that use data which has not been provided with the explicit consent of the data owner/creator. This data often lacks
other contextual information which can also make it difficult to understand how the dataset may be biased.

### Who are the owners/creators of the datasets you are using?

#### Have they provided explicit consent?

### Who/what is the data about?

## More information

More information about this hazard is available via the [Data Hazards Project website][1].

## Safety Precautions

- Being clear about the limitations of any ground truth inferences made from the data.
- Systems built solely with this type of data should not be applied in practice.
