# Hazard: Reinforces Existing Biases

## Description

## Prompts

* Does the input data contain intrinsic bias?
* Is the bias acceptable? (i.e. if it only contains data about a certain group because this is the scope of the project)
* If not, are there more representative alternatives? Or can we make the dataset more representative?
* Have you thought about which performance metrics are most applicable here to ensure you're not missing bias?
* Does the architecture of the technology particularly susceptible to bias?
