## Description

Ranking and classifications of people are hazards in their own right and should be handled with care.

### What happens when the ranking or classification of someone is inaccurate?

### Can people disagree with how they are ranked or classified?

### Who/what is the ranking or classification in service of?

### Can it be gamed?

## More information

More information about this hazard is available via the [Data Hazards Project website][1].

## Safety Precautions

- Test the effect of the algorithm or technology for different marginalised groups.
- Carefully consider the validity of any classification groups and work with subject specialists from the application area on this.
- Be transparent about what the weaknesses of the algorithm and technology are: test how can it be fooled.
- Consider alternatives to ranking/classification, for example treating people equally, increasing resources for the issue at hand, or allowing people to self-select.
- Consider the implication of sampling bias in the data used as inputs to classification models, which may result in over-representation of
particular demographic groups or might mean there is limited training data for particular classes.
