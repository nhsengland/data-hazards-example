## Description

## Prompts

* Which communities are relevant in this case?
* Do communities want, or benefit from this solution?
* Could communities be involved in the project as partners?
* How are issues of power, consent and trust present in your interaction with the relevant communities?
* What does automation bring to the process?
* Who is benefitted/harmed by this automation?
* Have you tested the effectiveness of the technology for different marginalised groups?
* Have you considered where you may inadvertently be [classifying or ranking](./ranks-classifies.md) one community over another when considering whose views 'count' towards addressing the research problem?
