## Description

This applies when technology is being produced without input from the community it is supposed to serve.

### Which communities are relevant in this case?

### Do communities want, or benefit from this solution?

### Could communities be involved in the project as partners?

### How are issues of power, consent and trust present in your interaction with the relevant communities?

### What does automation bring to the process?

### Who is benefitted/harmed by this automation?

### Have you tested the effectiveness of the technology for different marginalised groups?

### Have you considered where you may inadvertently be [classifying or ranking](ranks-classifies) one community over another when considering whose views 'count' towards addressing the research problem.
